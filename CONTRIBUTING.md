## How to Contribute ‚ö°


1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository's page on GitHub.
<br>

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pysertive.git
```
<br>

3. **Pick an Issue**: Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/abeltavares/pysertive/issues) tab and get an issue assigned to you. Simply comment `/assign` on an issue, and our GitHub Action will automatically assign the issue to you.
<br>

4. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

```
<br>

9. **Run Pre-commit Hooks**: Ensure your code passes all pre-commit hooks. These hooks will automatically check your code for common issues, type hinting and enforce consistent styling:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
<br>

```bash
git commit -m "Add your message here"
